React Vite User Info Page

This project demonstrates a React Vite application that displays user information on a dedicated page. It handles session-based authentication and avoids using local storage by leveraging Redis on the backend. The frontend state management is handled using React Context and Axios for API requests.


Features

Built with React + Vite for fast frontend development.

Dashboard showing user data retrieved from the backend and shown component based on user admin/user.

Session-based authentication â€” no local storage used for storing user data.

Backend uses Redis to manage session data securely.

React Context API is used for managing global user state on the frontend.

Axios handles all API requests to the backend.


Frontend: React, Vite, Axios, Context API

Backend: Node.js/Express (or your backend), Redis for session storage

Authentication: Session-based (no JWT/local storage)


How It Works

Backend:

Stores session data in Redis.

When a user logs in, a session is created and stored in Redis.

Backend exposes APIs to fetch user info using session ID.

Frontend:

Uses React Context to hold the current user state.

Fetches user info from backend using Axios on page load.

Updates the Context state so all components consuming the user data can access it.

No sensitive information is stored in local storage; all data comes from the session via backend.
